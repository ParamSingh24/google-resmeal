# 🍽️ Google ResQMeal

**Google ResQMeal** is a sustainability-driven web application that connects individuals and organizations with surplus food to verified donation centers nearby. The app uses smart logic (mock Gemini AI) to suggest the most suitable donation options based on the food type, quantity, and location — helping reduce food waste and support communities in need.
